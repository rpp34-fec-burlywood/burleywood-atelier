# FEC Burleywood Atelier

This is our team's Front End Capstone project. As part of the senior phase to test and grow our Front End Engineering skills. Each of our members worked on specific widgets to create an webstore application. The project includes React, Node, Axios, Express, Javascript, CSS, and Jest.

# Overarching Achievement

We built an online storefront accessing a heroku API for product data. The result is a modern storefront web application that allows the user to scroll through various products and zoom in on them, create an outfit from these products and compare different products, see the questions asked about these products, as well as their answers, and see the reviews and ratings for the particular product. The viewer may also report or mark questions, answers, and reviews or write their own.

Please take a look.
